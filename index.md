YNU-NLP laboratory focuses on research in the field of multimodal dialogue systems and multimodal expression. We are particularly interested in developing natural and intuitive ways for humans to interact with AI systems using multiple modalities, such as speech, text, and gestures. Our research aims to advance the state of the art in this area and to create practical applications that can improve human-computer communication and collaboration.
